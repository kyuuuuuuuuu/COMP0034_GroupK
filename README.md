Topic: School Catering (DinnersDirect)
by Koon Yew Ling, Trung Kien Nguyen and Yeo Jin Lee.

Welcome to our source code.

Before testing the code, please import dinnersdirect_schema.sql first then sample_data.sql to your local server.

Both of the 2 files can be found in the directory: "/COMP0034_GroupK/private/sql_code/"

dinnersdirect_schema.sql contains the code to create our database and create the username and password as we are using in credential.php.
While sample_data.sql contains the code to create the menu, items, school information, sample users for testing our function.

All of the password for sample users are "Default123" by default.

Details about our sample users and their access can be found in our report (section 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10).

For the staff log-in, username = "staff@dinnersdirect.co.uk", password = "Groupk123".

Apart from 1 file call "password.php", all of the code are written by us.

Kind regard,

Kien, Yeo Jin and Koon Yew.
