Topic: School Catering (DinnersDirect)
by Trung Kien Nguyen.

Welcome to our source code.

Before testing the code, please import 'dinnersdirect_schema.sql' first then 'sample_data.sql' to your local server.

Both of the 2 files can be found in the directory: "/COMP0034_GroupK/private/sql_code/"

'dinnersdirect_schema.sql' contains the code to create our database and create the username and password as we are using in credential.php.
While sample_data.sql contains the code to create the menu, items, school information, sample users for testing our function.

The starting URL show be "Your local server"/COMP0034_GroupK/public/pages/

All of the password for sample users are "Default123" by default.

Details about our sample users and their access can be found in our report (section 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10).

For the staff log-in, username = "staff@dinnersdirect.co.uk", password = "Groupk123".
The starting staff URL is "Your local server"/COMP0034_GroupK/public/staff/

Apart from 1 file call "password.php", all of the code are written by us.

Kind regard,

Trung Kien.
